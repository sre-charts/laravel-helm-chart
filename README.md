# Laravel Helm Charts

This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The code is provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```sh
helm repo add laravel https://sre-charts.github.io/laravel-helm-chart
```

You can then run `helm search repo laravel` to see the charts.
